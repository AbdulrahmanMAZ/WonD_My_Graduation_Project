# Introduction
There are so many limitations in the existing traditional services and workers
system. Some people will go and look around for a worker, others will open
google map and try to find shops numbers to ask for a worker. That process
will limit the customer to specific workers and in many cases end up not
finding a worker to do the work and leaving the whole work without working
on it. However, all of that could be replaced with one-click order, in no time
and nearby worker will come to help you. 
# Solution
To solve the previous problems and more we came up with the idea of
our app to allow the customer with one click to notify a nearby worker
asking for a service. That idea will eventually solve the following:
• Allow the customer to find many professions and services in one
place. 

# Project Scope
The project will mainly focus on making the customer & worker
experience a lot better than the regular methods. And by workers we
mean any man or women with a specific profession and want to make or
earn money with his hands work. Those workers will have the opportunity
to get job with no effort, and the customer will be any regular person
who want some help in any work. 

# Software
To develop and implement the idea into a real app we used the following
tools:
## Windows 11 The used OS
## VSCode Used ide
## Flutter Front-end and developing framework
## Firebase Back-end & Server
## Cloud Firestore Firebase built-in database
## Dart Main programming language
